Doors
-----

When you make a door, you can resize it. Set 'targetLevel' to the level you want (following the arcane rules below) to get the right parameters:

- The game must be required() in main.js, e.g. as 'game.levels.mylevel'
- 'targetLevel' must be "LevelMylevel" - first character capitalized, keep
  all other capitalization

Floating Text
-------------

Make the text and then set the 'text' value to anything you want.
