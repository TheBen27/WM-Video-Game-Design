[Textbox]
So far, the only thing we support are
garden-variety textboxes. There's no word wrap
(yet), so you have to break up your dialogue with
newlines so it doesn't go off-screen.

Textboxes only have space for 4 or 5 lines, so break up your
dialogue into multiple boxes using those tags.

Putting a line break isn't enough!
