## Getting Started

You're going to need some software.
* [sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

Impact.js is a javascirpt game engine- the whole thing works out of the browser. XAMPP turns a folder on your computer (C:/xampp) into a working web server. Open the xampp control panel and press "start" to the right of Apache. Now, go to your browser and type "localhost/" in the address bar. You should see something. If you do, then navigate to your C:/xampp directory and delete everything in it. If you don't your localhost is not working. One reason it often fails is because it conflicts with skype. Try closing skype and pressing "start" in xampp again.

Now, fire up sourcetree. Press Clone/New in the upper left hand corner. Paste "https://github.com/MichaelDarr/WM-Video-Game-Design" into the "Source Path / URL:" field. Then, for your desination path, navigate to the C:/xampp folder you were in a little while ago. Press "Clone" and you are good to go! Now, if you navigate to "localhost/" with your browser, you should see the game running.
