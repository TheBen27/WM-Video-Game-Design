Concept
=======

I hold the shift key and a glowing hologram appears before me, showing
me where I can teleport. As I move around, the hologram moves with me.

When I release the shift key, there's a flash as the player teleports
to that position.

The teleportation is determined by the following:
 - Has a maximum distance
 - Cannot throw you off the edge of the map
 - Can go through walls, but cannot land you in a wall

PLAYER
 + calculates and stores the position of the teleport clone
 + handles keyboard input
 + teleports player directly
 
PLAYER HOLOGRAM
 + represents the player's position

PLAYER
======

teleportPos: {x: -1, y: -1},

Keyboard Update
---------------
if shift is held:
  find the teleport position

when shift is released
  teleport the player to teleport position
  set position.x to -1

Is Teleporting
--------------
teleportPos.x !== -1

Find Teleport Position
----------------------
Run a trace from to

clamp(position + max teleport distance, 0, map width)

the player's position (on the CollisionMap)

If nothing is found, set teleportPos to the farthest
position. Otherwise, set it to the collision position.

HOLOGRAM
========
Init
----
grab player

Update
------
if the player is teleporting:
  set the hologram's position to teleportDest
else:
  set the hologram's position to (-200, -200)
